# PosterVote

PosterVote is a research project at [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk), which is a cross-disciplinary research group at [Newcastle University](https://ncl.ac.uk) in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

This research is funded under the Digital Economy Research Centre, [DERC](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/M023001/1).

## About

PosterVote is made up of a small device, printed A4 posters and the PosterVote service.
The device makes the buttons on the poster clickable, so every click is logged.
People can call in to PosterVote and play a special sound down the phone which registers the votes with the service.
Once registered, you can view the results of your poll online.

## How it works

1. You create a poster on the website, [postervote.openlab.ncl.ac.uk](https://postervote.openlab.ncl.ac.uk), where you set the question and up to 5 options to choose form.
2. Print out your poster using a generated PDF on the website.
3. Attach the PosterVote device and call the registration number to link the device to your poster.
4. Place the poster in place and gather your votes.
5. You or voters can call in to register votes and also recieve an SMS with the poll's results.
6. You can view you poster's results online, showing the last registered votes.
