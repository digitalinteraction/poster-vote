# Device Setup

This page contains information on setting up new PosterVote devices.

## Instructions

1. Create your poster on [postervote.openlab.ncl.ac.uk](https://postervote.openlab.ncl.ac.uk)
2. Get your PosterVote device and battery
3. Tentatively put the battery in. You can hook in one side and press down (without clicking it in) which starts the boot process
5. You’ll see lights on the buttons “loading”, this indicates the boot process has begun
6. While booting hold the first 3 buttons (from the battery going away) and release them after the poster stops beeping
7. Wait until all the flashing lights have stopped
8. Push the battery in fully
9. Register the poster with the website (the instructions on the back of the generated PDF)

## Notes

You don't have to use the generated PDF, but it is required to call-in for votes 
and it has the poster-device pairing information on the back.
